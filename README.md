## Introduction
There are decisions to be made every day. Such decisions also include choosing where to eat today's dinner. We are limited by factors such as time, money, or availability of ingredients in the fridge. Our decision tree is designed to solve such doubts, taking into account how rich in resources we are to eat the desired meal. According to our program, we can eat lunch in three main forms: handmade, eaten at the restaurant and ordered for delivery. We take the following factors into account:  
* *Time of preparation:* How much time do we have? The variable is divided into 3 categories (up to 15 minutes, from 15 to 30 minutes, over 30 minutes)  
* *Money:* What's the budget for today's dinner? Here also a division into 3 categories (up to 10 PLN, from 10 to 20 PLN, over 20 PLN)  
* *Availability of ingredients:* How rich in ingredients is our fridge? There is a division into 4 categories (no ingredients, low availability, medium availability, high availability)  
* *Hunger level:* How hungry are we? There are two possibilities: a little or very hungry.  
* *Range from the premises:* How many minutes do we have to get to the nearest point with food? Time division into 3 categories (up to 2 minutes, from 2 to 10 minutes, more than 10 minutes)  
  
## Methodology
In our project we use the division into branches according to entropy. We managed to automate the process of dividing the tree, thanks to which after applying the function in response we will get a tree divided horizontally. After answering the question from a given level, you should move on to the next level until you get one of three possible decisions. We also attach to the work a graphical representation of the decision tree. The attachments will also include a file with data to which we have assigned the decisions ourselves.
